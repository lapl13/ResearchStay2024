# Research Stay - Final Project

## Introduction

In natural language processing, accurately detecting and classifying emotions from textual data is a pivotal challenge, with far-reaching applications in sentiment analysis, customer feedback interpretation, and human-computer interaction. This final project is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in this intricate domain of machine learning. The task involves the preparation, analysis, and emotion annotation of a text dataset, employing three distinct computational approaches: rule-based, neural networks, and deep learning.
