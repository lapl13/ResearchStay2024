# **Week 13: Fine-Tuning BERT for Domain-Specific NLP Tasks**

## **Objectives:**

Week 13 explores the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models like BERT for domain-specific tasks. By adapting these models to specialized datasets, we can achieve better performance in fields such as healthcare, legal, or financial text analysis.

- Understand the process of fine-tuning BERT for specific domains.
- Explore domain-specific datasets for training and evaluation.
- Implement and evaluate fine-tuned BERT models for classification tasks in specialized fields.

## **Code Examples**

### Example 1 - Fine-Tuning BERT for Medical Text Classification:
This example demonstrates the fine-tuning of a pre-trained BERT model on a medical dataset (e.g., MIMIC-III or PubMed). The goal is to classify medical text, such as patient notes or research abstracts, into categories like diagnosis or treatment.

**Highlights**:
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenize and encode medical text for input into the BERT model.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Add a classification head and train the model using labeled data.
- **Evaluation**: Assess the model using accuracy and F1-score on a test set.

**Applications**:
- Categorizing medical research abstracts.
- Analyzing patient notes for key information extraction.

### Example 2 - Domain Adaptation with BERT:
This example extends the use of BERT to another domain, such as financial text. By fine-tuning on datasets like SEC filings or earnings call transcripts, BERT learns domain-specific terminology and improves classification accuracy.

**Highlights**:
- **Pre-trained Weights**: Start with general BERT weights and fine-tune on financial text.
- **Specialized Training**: Adapt to tasks such as sentiment analysis or risk assessment.
- **Metrics**: Evaluate performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Applications**:
- Sentiment analysis of financial reports.
- Risk assessment in regulatory filings.
