# **Week 12: Leveraging Transformers for Text Classification**

## **Objectives:**

Week 12 focuses on the application of transformer architectures in text classification tasks. Transformers, powered by self-attention mechanisms, excel in processing long and complex text sequences. This week’s goal is to leverage pre-trained transformer models like BERT to classify text data efficiently and accurately.

- Understand the transformer architecture and its advantages over traditional models.
- Fine-tune pre-trained transformers for domain-specific text classification tasks.
- Evaluate transformer-based models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## **Code Examples**

### Example 1 - Fine-Tuning BERT for Text Classification:
This example demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model for a text classification task. The model is trained on labeled datasets to predict categories such as spam or topic labels.

**Highlights**:
- **Pre-trained Weights**: Start with BERT’s pre-trained weights for language modeling.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt BERT to the classification task by adding a task-specific classification head.
- **Training**: Train on labeled datasets such as AG News or IMDb reviews.

**Applications**:
- Spam detection in email datasets.
- Topic categorization for news articles.

### Example 2 - Evaluation of Transformer Models:
This example illustrates the evaluation of fine-tuned transformer models using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, and F1-score. 

**Highlights**:
- **Data Preparation**: Preprocess text into tokenized inputs for transformers.
- **Model Inference**: Use the fine-tuned model to predict classes for new inputs.
- **Metrics**: Calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for performance evaluation.

**Applications**:
- Sentiment analysis of product reviews.
- Categorization of research papers by topic.
