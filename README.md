# **Tec Research Stay Aug - Dec 2024**  
**Going Beyond Artificial Intelligence: Artificial Emotions**

This repository documents the **17-week research stay** focusing on developing an unsupervised, scalable, and reliable emotion-tagged model. The project aims to explore and advance the field of Artificial Emotions, with the following key objectives:

## **Objectives:**
1. **Emotion-Tagged Model Development:**  
   Develop an **unsupervised, scalable, and reliable emotion-tagged model** to train a Machine Learning model for Text Emotion Detection. The model aims to mitigate biases from the data source, including language dependency, demographic representativity, and excessive reliance on human criteria.

2. **Unsupervised Emotion Classification:**  
   Create an **Unsupervised Machine Learning model** to classify short English texts from Twitter organically. The model should identify at least **8 different emotions** to distinguish the research from traditional Sentiment Analysis.

3. **Emotion Model Proposal and Benchmarking:**  
   Propose an **Emotion Model** that fits the classification above and compare it against the existing **GoEmotions dataset** to establish a baseline for performance.

4. **Cross-Language Model Testing:**  
   Once an acceptable performance is achieved, the **Unsupervised Machine Learning model** will be tested on texts in Spanish.

## **Repository Structure:**
Each week of the research stay has its own folder, which contains:

- **Readings:**  
  Provided by the professor.
  
- **Self-Researched Readings:**  
  Additional readings identified and reviewed independently.

- **Weekly PPT Document:**  
  - **Context:** Background and relevance of the weekly focus.
  - **Search Methodology:** Description of how the additional documents were found and the criteria for their selection.
  - **Preliminary Terms:** Key terms identified during the week.
  - **Document Comparison:** Comparative analysis of the reviewed documents.

- **Proof-of-Concept Example:**  
  Demonstrative example or prototype related to the weekly focus.

- **Sample Code Execution:**  
  Execution of the sample code provided by the professor.
