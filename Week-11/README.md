# **Week 11: Encoder-Decoder with Attention for Sentiment Analysis**

## **Objectives:**

Week 11 focuses on applying Encoder-Decoder architectures with attention mechanisms to sentiment analysis tasks. This approach allows the model to dynamically focus on relevant parts of the input sequence, improving its ability to classify sentiment, especially in long or complex text sequences.

- Understand how Encoder-Decoder architectures can be adapted for classification tasks.
- Explore the role of attention mechanisms in identifying sentiment-rich sections of text.
- Implement and evaluate Encoder-Decoder models with attention for sentiment classification.

## **Code Examples**

### Example 1 - Encoder-Decoder with Attention for Sentiment Analysis:
This example demonstrates the use of an Encoder-Decoder model with attention for sentiment classification. The attention mechanism ensures that the decoder focuses on the most relevant parts of the input sequence during sentiment prediction.

**Highlights**:
- **Encoder**: Processes the input text and generates a sequence of hidden states.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Computes attention weights to identify sentiment-rich words.
- **Decoder**: Uses attention-weighted context to classify the sentiment of the input text.

**Applications**:
- Classifying customer reviews with mixed sentiments.
- Identifying sentiment trends in lengthy social media posts.

### Example 2 - Training and Evaluation:
This example covers the training process for Encoder-Decoder models with attention, using labeled sentiment datasets. Key steps include:
- **Data Preparation**: Tokenizing text and creating input-output pairs for training.
- **Training Process**: Minimizing cross-entropy loss to improve sentiment prediction accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measuring performance using accuracy and F1-score.

**Applications**:
- Sentiment analysis for customer service feedback.
- Text analysis for emotional tone detection.
