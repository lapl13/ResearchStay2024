# **Week 5: Neural Networks**


## **Objectives:**

Week 5 focuses on Neural Networks, a machine learning model inspiled after te human brain, consisting of interconnecrted layers of nodes (neurons). Neural Networks are used to mimic human-like pattern-recognition, decision-making, among other things. This week we used two code examples, briefly explained below:
 
### Example 1 - XOR problem: 
In this example, we built a simple neural network to solve the famous XOR problem. The XOR problem is a classic binary classification problem, where the output is 0 if both input bits are the same, and 1 if they are different.

### Example 2 - Image classifying CNN: 
In this example, we built and train a deep CNN to classify images of clothing items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The Fashion-MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images, each representing a different clothing category, such as shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.
