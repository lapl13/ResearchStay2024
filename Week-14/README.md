# **Week 14: Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation in NLP**

## **Objectives:**

Week 14 focuses on applying transfer learning techniques for domain adaptation in natural language processing (NLP). By leveraging pre-trained models and adapting them to specific domains, we can achieve high accuracy with minimal labeled data, making these techniques highly efficient and scalable.

- Understand the concept of transfer learning and its benefits in NLP tasks.
- Explore domain adaptation by fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific fields like finance or healthcare.
- Implement and evaluate transfer learning pipelines for domain-specific tasks.

## **Code Examples**

### Example 1 - Domain Adaptation for Financial Text Analysis:
This example demonstrates how to fine-tune a pre-trained model like BERT for analyzing financial text. The model is trained on datasets like SEC filings or earnings call transcripts to classify text into categories such as risk, sentiment, or topic.

**Highlights**:
- **Dataset Preparation**: Preprocess and tokenize financial text data.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adapt pre-trained BERT to the financial domain by training on labeled datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Measure model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Applications**:
- Sentiment analysis of market reports.
- Topic classification of financial filings.

### Example 2 - Transfer Learning for Healthcare Text:
This example focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained model for healthcare-related tasks, such as classifying patient notes or identifying clinical terms in medical records.

**Highlights**:
- **Specialized Training**: Fine-tune on datasets like MIMIC-III to adapt the model to medical terminology.
- **Task-Specific Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy and recall to evaluate performance.
- **Domain-Specific Adaptations**: Capture unique patterns in clinical language for improved results.

**Applications**:
- Categorizing patient records by diagnosis.
- Extracting clinical findings from unstructured text.
